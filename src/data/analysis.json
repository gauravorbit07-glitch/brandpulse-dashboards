            "summary": "Purpose: This report benchmarks Gong's AI/LLM-driven visibility for AI, Revenue, and Data Engine queries against five direct competitors in the revenue intelligence and sales engagement space. Visibility score: Gong's weighted visibility score of 285 places it firmly in the High tier, demonstrating strong LLM surface presence. Comparative results: Gong leads in AI-related queries and ties with Clari for Revenue query visibility, while showing competitive positioning on Data Engine queries. Outreach and SalesLoft maintain strong overall visibility in sales engagement contexts, while Chorus.ai shows solid conversation intelligence positioning. Attention demonstrates emerging niche presence. Strengths: Gong exhibits category-defining leadership in conversation intelligence and revenue intelligence queries with exceptional presence across brand documentation, integration ecosystems, reviews, blogs, and social channels. The brand benefits from prolific thought leadership, comprehensive product documentation, and extensive analyst recognition. Weaknesses: Generic AI and Data Engine queries show diluted positioning against broader technology competitors; opportunities exist to consolidate fragmented content into canonical LLM-optimized resources and enhance structured data implementation. Notable trends: LLM surfaces strongly favor authoritative category-defining content, structured technical documentation, and quantified customer outcomes; integration ecosystem breadth significantly enhances cross-platform discoverability. Top insight: Focus on creating 5-7 canonical intent-to-solution pages for high-value query patterns (revenue intelligence platform, conversation AI for sales, AI revenue operations) with comprehensive schema markup to convert strong overall visibility into dominant top-two featured answer positions.",
